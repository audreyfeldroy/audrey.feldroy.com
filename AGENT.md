# Project: audrey.feldroy.com

## 1. Project Overview

This folder contains my blog. Each post is a Jupyter notebook that gets rendered as a web page. The `main.py` uses Air, the new Python web framework that Daniel Roy Greenfeld and I are writing.

## 2. Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Web Framework: Air (built on Starlette, FastAPI, Pydantic, Jinja2)
- Frontend: Pico.css is being replaced with Tailwind CSS with only Tailwind classes, no custom CSS.
- Syntax Highlighting: Pygments

## 3. Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main application file using the Air framework.
- `nbs/`: Contains all the Jupyter Notebook blog posts, and soon Marimo notebook blog posts.
- `scripts/`: Contains random scripts generated by the Jupyter Notebooks, used for the blog, 
- `static/`: Currently CSS and JS are inline, and there are no static assets. In the future we may have at least a favicon. We want to create inline SVGs for images rather than using static images if images are needed in the future.
- `templates/`: There are currently no Jinja2 templates. All HTML is constructed in functions in `main.py`. If you ever want to redesign a page, first generate static HTML in templates/ and we can see how it looks. Then if we like it, we can convert it to a Jinja2 template as an intermediate step, and finally refactor to generating the HTML with Air tags.
- `pyproject.toml`: Use `uv sync` with this to update project dependencies.

## 4. Development Workflow

- Run blog: `uv run fastapi dev main.py --reload &`
- Run tests: There are no tests right now (sorry!), but soon it will be `pytest`
- Linter/Formatter: `ruff format main.py` for now. 

## 5. Approach to Building

- Code in tiny, easy-to-review diffs.
- Focus on teaching me new tricks, skills, and techniques with each improvement you make to the codebase.
- My understanding is higher priority than having the best design.
- Ask questions if you don't understand things about Air or the codebase.
- Use clean, modern code. (Note: I was following fastai's hard-to-read coding style, but now I am moving to a modern readable Python style with type hints and other best practices.)
- Anything that helps with maintainability, readability, and performance is welcome. But no architecture astronauting.

## 6. Deployment

- Continuous deployment on Railway.
