    "Today, Anthropic launched the most powerful language model available: Claude 3.5 Sonnet. And today, we are making it ever better, with the launch of _Claudette_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claudette makes Anthropic’s SDK, which is used for working with Claude, much more convenient. The SDK works well, but it is quite low level – it leaves the developer to do a lot of stuff manually. That’s a lot of extra work and boilerplate. Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A `Chat` class that creates stateful dialogs\n",
    "  * Support for _prefill_ , which tells Claude what to use as the first few words of its response\n",

    "Note that this library is the first ever “literate nbdev” project. That means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images, detailed explanations, and teaches _how_ and _why_ the code is written the way it is. Even if you’ve never used the Anthropic Python SDK or Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Check out Claudette’s Source to read it, or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to see every step of the creation process in action. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is because we take seriously Knuth’s call to action, that we have a “ _moral commitment_ ” to never write an “ _illiterate program_ ” – and so we have a commitment to making literate programming and easy and pleasant experience. (For more on this, see this talk from Hamel Husain.)\n",
