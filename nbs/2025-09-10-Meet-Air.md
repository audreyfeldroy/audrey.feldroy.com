# Meet Air: A Breath of Fresh Air for Python Web Development

The new Python web framework I've been working on.

## The Problem

I love Python: it's sheer joy to build with it. However, web development with Python involves too much context-switching between Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.

If it's hard for humans to context-switch, imagine how hard it is for LLMs to do it.

What if you didn't have to leave Python? What if you could build your entire web app with Python? And what if you could do it in a way that's compatible with mainstream Python web development with FastAPI and Pydantic?

## The Solution

Today, I want to tell you about Air, a new web framework that does just that. It’s my and [Daniel Roy Greenfeld](https://daniel.feldroy.com/)'s new take on web development. 

A word of warning: Air is young and evolving fast. We're still figuring out what it wants to be when it grows up. But what’s already here is exciting, and we want you to be a part of its journey.

## AI-First

We're taking an AI-first approach, designing the web framework to work well with agentic coding tools from the very start. By testing Air every day with a variety of coding agents, we see what isn't intuitive to LLMs and fix it.

## Generating HTML From Python

Air started with Air Tags. With Air Tags, every HTML tag is a Python class.

Forget about < and >, or manually escaping strings. Want to create a heading and a paragraph? Just do this:

```python
import air

my_content = air.Div(
    air.H1("Hello from Air!", class_="title"),
    air.P("This was written entirely in Python."),
    style="font-family: sans-serif;"
)
```

This Python code generates the following HTML:

```html
<div style="font-family: sans-serif;">
    <h1 class="title">Hello from Air!</h1>
    <p>This was written entirely in Python.</p>
</div>
```

Notice how class_ automatically becomes class in the output. Air handles these little impedance mismatches for you. This approach has huge advantages:

* Auto-completion and Type-Hinting: Your IDE knows what air.H1 is. It can offer you attributes and catch typos.
* Programmatic UI: You can use loops, conditionals, and functions to generate complex UIs with ease.
* Composability: You can build your own reusable components as Python functions or classes, just like you would with any other code.

This isn't a new idea: Dash, Reflex, FastHTML, and a ton of web frameworks already do it.

## More Than Just Tags: Layouts and Forms

Air isn't just a tag generator; it's a framework for building real applications.

For rapid prototyping, Air comes with built-in layouts that use modern, classless CSS frameworks. With a single function call, you can get a beautiful, responsive page complete with HTMX.

```python
@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return air.picocss(
        air.Title("My Awesome App"),
        air.H1("Welcome!"),
        air.P("This page looks great with zero CSS effort.")
    )
```

And what about handling user input? This is where Air truly shines by integrating with Pydantic. You can define your form data as a Pydantic model, and Air will handle the validation and rendering for you.

```python
import pydantic
import air

class SignupModel(pydantic.BaseModel):
    email: pydantic.EmailStr
    name: str = air.AirField(min_length=2, label="Your Name")
    age: int = air.AirField(gt=18, label="Age")

class SignupForm(air.AirForm):
    model = SignupModel

@app.post("/signup")
async def handle_signup(form: SignupForm = Depends(SignupForm.from_request)):
    if form.is_valid:
        # Process form.data.email, form.data.name, etc.
        return air.H1(f"Welcome, {form.data.name}!")
    # The form will re-render with error messages
    return MyPage(form=form)
```

Air automatically generates the HTML form from your Pydantic model, complete with labels and validation error states. It’s a seamless bridge between your backend data contracts and your frontend presentation.

## Built on a Foundation of Giants

Air is built directly on top of FastAPI, so you get the entire FastAPI ecosystem for free: async support, dependency injection, automatic OpenAPI docs, and incredible performance.

Air simply provides a more Pythonic way to handle the "V" in MVC (Model-View-Controller). You can even mount a standard FastAPI app alongside your Air pages for maximum flexibility.

Prefer Jinja2? Air has first-class support for Jinja templates, with a simplified renderer that’s even easier to use than vanilla FastAPI.

## Truly Free Software

It has become a trend where web frameworks claim to be free and open source, and they claim that you can host your project on any host, but when you actually try to self-host you run into vendor lock-in.

Air is different. We believe in true freedom. You can take your Air app and run it anywhere, without being tied to a specific platform or service. We will never build a cloud hosting platform because it's a conflict of interest.

As Air's creators we have a long history of creating open source projects just to give away, to share and collaborate with the community. We love PyCon sprints, free software ideals, and **the power of community-driven development**.

## An Invitation to Build the Future

Air is in alpha. The paint is still wet, and the architecture is evolving. Our vision is a minimalist core with a rich ecosystem of plugins, but the final shape is still unknown.

This is where you come in.

We’re releasing Air now because we want to build it with the community. The core ideas are powerful, and we’re excited to see where you take them.

So, take a deep breath. Give it a try, in a new app or existing FastAPI project:

    uv add air

Read the [documentation](https://feldroy.github.io/air/), run the examples, and see what you can build. Then, come talk to us! Open an issue on GitHub with your ideas, feedback, or pull requests.

Let’s build the future of Python web development together.
