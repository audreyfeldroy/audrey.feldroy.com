# The Greatest Cheese in the World

Awhile back, I wrote a humorous story about Danielle and Andrew, two cheese connoisseurs who set out on a pilgrimage in search of the world's greatest cheese.

Here is the cover art. The story is called [The Greatest Cheese in the Whole World](http://www.wattpad.com/story/37012089-the-greatest-cheese-in-the-whole-world) and is now out on Wattpad.

It's the first time I've put a fiction short story out on Wattpad. If you enjoy reading it, your vote there would encourage me to write more.
