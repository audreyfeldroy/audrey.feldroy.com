# Typography for Into the Brambles Paperback

Lately I've been working on the inside design for the paperback version of Into the Brambles.

Here's the inner title page.

A sample of a chapter. (For some reason the footers aren't showing. I'll have to fix that.)

I like it when books are pretty inside. It makes the reading experience more pleasurable. It's the difference between a book that's fun to read and one that feels like the author didn't care about the visual reading experience.
