# Kalinga Means Care: Air ❤️ PythonAsia 2026

Air Web Framework exists not just because we created it, but because of the support we got soft-launching it at Python Philippines and running its first sprint at PyCon Davao. Now, Air is a PythonAsia 2026 community partner.

## Kalinga in Everything

In the Philippines, **Kalinga** is a word that in multiple regional languages roughly means **loving, nurturing care and support**. It has a warm, protective tone often associated with parenting and healing. Every volunteer on the PythonPH/PythonAsia team lives and breathes this, and it's beautiful.

The theme of PythonAsia 2026 is **kalinga**.

Inspired by the PythonPH/PythonAsia team and this concept of **kalinga**, Daniel Roy Greenfeld and I have been the **ninong** and **ninang** of the PythonAsia 2026 team, the loving godparents who cheer on their achievements, listen with deep care, and find ways to be supportive while giving everyone room to grow.

This has provided amazing dividends. Air would be nothing without the kalinga of the PythonPH, DurianPy, and PythonAsia communities. They've been there for us since the very beginning, members contributing code and community support.

Note: Last month Daniel went on leave from Air due to a [head injury](https://daniel.feldroy.com/tags/concussion). I've stepped up as Air's lead while doing my best to nurture him to full health.

## Community Partnership

Air is an official PythonAsia 2026 community partner! What this means is not just the obvious cross-promotion stuff but that as project lead I'm really thinking deeply about what **kalinga** means for Air:

* I'm listening thoughtfully to local pain points with other web frameworks in order to make Air much better at meeting the needs of the Python community, particularly for Asia.
* Air's sprints will be not just about contributing to Air core, but about supporting the creation of new Asian Python open source projects. If new projects are Air packages/web apps or packages created with Cookiecutter PyPackage, I'll help and mentor.

Open to ideas from the Air community as well - join the [Discord](https://airwebframework.org/discord/) and share how we can make this great.
