# Rediscovery

This painting represents my recent experiences. Paths in various uncertain directions are overlapped with spiraling curves revisiting the past and building upon it. Along the way, beauty shows up in the most unexpected places.

I started my day by painting this. It's 9 x 12 in. I found it very relaxing and therapeutic.
