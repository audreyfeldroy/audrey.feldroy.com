# Butterflies

Daniel and I painted these butterflies with gouache, pastels, and a brush pen. Originally my intent was to experiment with butterfly shapes for republishing my butterfly book, but then I decided to play around with brush shapes and mark-making. Daniel joined in the fun of giving the butterflies their beautiful coloration with me.
