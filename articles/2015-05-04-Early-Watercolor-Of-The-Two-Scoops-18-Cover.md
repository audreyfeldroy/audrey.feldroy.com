# Early Watercolor of the Two Scoops 1.8 Cover

Here's an earlier snapshot of a work-in-progress version of the Two Scoops of Django 1.8 book cover. This one was a watercolor painting.

In this variation, I opted for less distinctive lettering in order to focus the viewer's attention on the surrounding plants.  
  
The black strokes aren't pen-and-ink here, although the original was. At this point I had vectorized the line drawings in Inkscape, and this was a printout on white cardstock.  
  
I wanted to post this and other in-progress artwork sooner! But I didn't want to spoil the surprise. More in-progress Two Scoops 1.8 art to come.
