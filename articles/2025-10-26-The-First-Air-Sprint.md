# The First Air Sprint

I co-led the first ever Air web framework sprint in Davao, Philippines, as part of Day 2 of PyCon Davao on October 26, 2025.

## Sprint Leads

The Air sprint was led by Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Sony Valdez, Micaela Reyes, Matt Lebrun, and myself.

## What Happened

Sprinters first worked through enough Air tutorial material to understand the basics of the web framework, then filed issues for needed improvements or chose GitHub issues to work on.

As sprint leads, we mentored new Air contributors all day. A lot of people say you can't get great work from new contributors, but that's not true at all. We merged 28 great pull requests.
