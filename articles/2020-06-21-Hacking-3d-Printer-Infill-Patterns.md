# Hacking 3D Printer Infill Patterns

I 3D-printed these earrings using a cool little hack of setting top and bottom wall thickness to 0.  
  
The pattern is the Tri-Hexagon infill that comes built-in with Ultimaker Cura. Other than the unusual wall thickness setting, the other settings are the defaults for the Standard Quality 0.2mm profile.

The infill hack is by Penolopy Bulnick. I followed [her Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Print-Infill-Jewelry/) to learn how infill patterns work in 3D printing.
