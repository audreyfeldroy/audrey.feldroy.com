# Flowers and a Blue Potato

I've painted yet another tribute to a Chris Foss illustration I'm obsessed with. This version has flowers instead of an explosion, and the asteroid is actually a blue potato.

There's [a really nice illustration by Chris Foss](http://www.chrisfossart.com/2011/08/philip-k-dick/) that I've been particularly inspired by: the cover art for Philip K. Dick's A Handful of Darkness. I'm a bit obsessed with that piece. I've created a few tributes to it involving rainbows shooting out of the asteroid.
