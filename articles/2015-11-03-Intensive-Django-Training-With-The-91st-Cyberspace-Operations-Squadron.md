# Intensive Django Training With the 91st Cyberspace Operations Squadron

Daniel and I just returned from a trip to San Antonio, Texas, where we taught one of our intensive Django training workshops at Lackland Air Force Base.  
  
We prepared a customized version of our curriculum to meet the needs of the [91st Cyberspace Operations Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/91st_Cyberspace_Operations_Squadron) of the US Air Force.

Teaching such a sharp, enthusiastic group and seeing everyone grasp difficult concepts so rapidly was a huge thrill. As instructors who like challenges, we tend to err on the side of assuming that our students can handle anything, so we threw a lot of very advanced topics at the group, wondering how much would click. On the last day as they were putting their knowledge into practice during hands-on project time, it was apparent that even the hardest parts had made an imprint.
