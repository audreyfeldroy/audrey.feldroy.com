# Watercolor and Stenciled Paper Mandalas

I love using recycled materials. I cut out these snowflakes from the heavy cardstock backing piece of a pack of markers. I estimate it as 120-150lb cardstock. The 3-inch piece cut well, but the 2-inch one didn't cut cleanly.

They are so light and airy in the hands, like the prettiest snowflakes. I love the rainbow line patterns on the 3-inch mandala above.

I did a second test with thinner, lighter 80 lb. cardstock. Results were similar with 2-inch and 3+ inch mandala cuts. The 3-inch piece from the heavier cardstock was much nicer, though.

Here I tried using the 3-inch 80 lb. cardstock mandala as a stencil with watercolor paint. I brush-stamped a rainbow of colors on with a stencil brush.

Next time I'll use more concentrated watercolor paint and heavier backing paper so it doesn't wrinkle. Simple hot-press watercolor paper seems like the way to go.  
  
I got the design for the mandala from a site called [Free SVG Designs](https://freesvgdesigns.com/) that is run by Erin, a graphic designer and papercrafter who generously shares the cut files that she makes. This particular design is called [Mandala Monogram 381](https://freesvgdesigns.com/mandala-monogram-381/). Let me know if you try this out or have any tips!
