# Ride a Bike Today

My husband Daniel and I created this piece together during the holidays, and I forgot to post it so I'm doing so now. It started with a pen-and-ink drawing I drew. Then we transformed it several times, alternating photocopier distortion, gouache, watercolor, house paint, more pen and ink, and collage over and over.  
  
I didn't tell my husband at the time, but the piece was actually about him. This was how I imagined him in long hair during his NASA days, bundling up no matter how stormy the weather was and fearlessly cycling to work 13 miles each way every day. He inspired me to get a bike for the first time in years. I'm slowly building up the courage to be fearless about cycling like him.
