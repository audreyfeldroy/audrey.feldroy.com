# Timelapse Video of Baby Uma Crawling

Today I experimented with making timelapse video and iMovie effects.  
  
  
  
My experience as a new mother is that time travels significantly faster. It feels like yesterday our baby was born, and today she is 10 months old. This video is a glimpse into what that feeling is like.
