# River and Mountains

Few are aware that J. R. R. Tolkien was as great an artist as a writer. His art is incredibly inspiring. It inspired me to paint this piece.  
  
This is the first of a new series of mine of paintings inspired by Tolkien's drawings and paintings. This piece is called River and Mountains.
