# Healing and Survival Come First

Last month Danny had a bad head injury. Sometimes he seems totally fine, other times he's not.

I've become the pillar holding up my family, finding strength I didn't know I have. I've suddenly taken on the solo roles of being my family's breadwinner, secretary, food delivery person, etc. I accompany Danny and Uma to all their appointments. I go for 18 hours straight from the moment I naturally wake up to when I pass out from exhaustion. If I'm lucky I squeeze a nap in.

Danny's healing well. All the projects we planned will continue, just not at the pace everyone wants.

Healing and survival come first.
