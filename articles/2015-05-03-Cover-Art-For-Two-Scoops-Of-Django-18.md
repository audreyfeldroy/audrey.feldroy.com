# Cover Art for Two Scoops of Django 1.8

Here's the cover illustration for our latest book, Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.8. It depicts vines growing ice cream cones.  

I did the cover by hand with pen and ink, scanning and converting my drawings to vector art and then coloring them digitally. For all the digital work, I used Inkscape.

The colors stand out on tablets quite nicely.

I also did the 50+ interior illustrations and [wrote half the book](http://www.codemakesmehappy.com/2015/05/two-scoops-of-django-18-is-out.html). I'll be posting more about the art in the coming weeks.
