# Voronoi Mandalas

SciPy has tools for creating Voronoi tessellations. Besides the obvious data science applications, you can use them to make pretty art like this:

I started with Carlos Focil's [mandalapy](https://github.com/CarlosFocil/mandalapy) code, modifying the parameters until I had a design I liked. I decided to make the Voronoi diagram show both points and vertices, and I gave it an equal aspect ratio. Carlos' mandalapy code is a port of [Antonio Sánchez Chinchón](https://fronkonstin.com/)'s inspiring work [drawing mandalas with R](https://fronkonstin.com/2018/02/14/mandalas/), using the [deldir](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deldir/index.html) library to plot Voronoi tesselations.
