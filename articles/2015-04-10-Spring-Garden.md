# Spring Garden

Abstract art is deceptively hard to create. It always looks so easy that a child could do it, yet it practice it's one of the hardest things.  
  
I'm still a beginner when it comes to abstract painting, but I'd like to improve. I'll try to make some of my 100 Days of Watercolor paintings abstract or semi-abstract just for the practice. To start, here's a semi-abstract spring garden.
