# Simple Garden

I have a confession to make. Sometimes when I work on my paintings for the 100 day project, I do them at night right before bed when I'm completely exhausted. My state of mind in these situations is wanting to get the painting over with as quickly as possible so I can get to bed.  
  
On those days, I end up drawing the first thing that comes to mind, before the critical part of my brain can veto it and tell myself not to draw it.  
  
Normally that critical voice would say, "Don't draw flowers! Other people already draw flowers! Draw something else!"  
  
But last night, as with the other nights of exhaustion, the critical voice was asleep. Only the tired voice was still up.

"Hey, just draw flowers if you really want to," the tired voice said. "Just draw whatever makes you feel happy and warm inside, so that I can go to bed."  
  
So I started drawing. I drew and drew without thinking. I was probably even asleep while drawing part of this. And then I painted it as fast as possible before climbing into bed.  
  
It came out rather nice in the end. I realized afterward how much I was subconsciously inspired by my friend [Annanda's project](https://instagram.com/p/1OcuL9gp0V/?taken-by=4nnanda) to do 100 days of coloring in a flowery coloring book. That was a nice surprise.  
  
I remember being less self-conscious like this, back when I was in my 20s and had my art studio in San Francisco and then Oakland. I made lots of rainbows and didn't care because they just made me happy.
